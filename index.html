      <h2>What is Physics?</h2>
      <p>
        Physics is the natural science that studies matter, its fundamental constituents, its motion and behavior through space and time, and the related entities of energy and force. It seeks to understand how the universe behaves at the most fundamental level.

      <h2>Key Methodologies in Physics</h2>
      <p>
        Physics relies on a combination of observation, experimentation, and mathematical modeling. The scientific method is used extensively, involving hypothesis formulation, controlled experiments, data collection, and analysis to validate or refute theories.

      <h2>Experiments in Physics</h2>
      <p>
        Experiments are crucial in physics to test predictions and uncover new phenomena. From classical setups like pendulums and inclined planes to modern particle accelerators and quantum optics labs, experimentation grounds theoretical physics in empirical evidence.
