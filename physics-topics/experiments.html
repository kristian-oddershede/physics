      <h2>What are Physics Experiments?</h2>
      <p>
        Experiments are the foundation of physics. They aim to disprove theories, and the theories that stand the test of time 
        and our contious scientific efforts - are the theories we consider to be true (or at least our best current theories).
      </p>

      Main thing to know: <br />
      <strong>Experiments try to disprove theories in under to test the limits of theories.</strong>

      <h2>An example of the methods</h2>
      <p>
        In the following, there are brief descriptions and images from an experimental bachelor project. It aimed 
        to study the possibility of trapping neutral atoms through a special trap called a MOT (Magneto Optical Trap).
        It uses lasers and a magnetic field to do so.

      <h2>Theory - Key Equations for atomic trapping</h2>
      Very briefly are here some key equations, that are essential for why trapping of neutral atoms may be possible - if we trust the theory.
    
      <div class="equation">
        
    
    \[
          F_{\text{scatt}} = \hbar k \cdot \frac{\Gamma}{2} \cdot \frac{I/I_{\text{sat}}}{1 + I/I_{\text{sat}} + \left( \frac{2\Delta}{\Gamma} \right)^2}
        \]
    
    
        <div class="equation-desc">
          Scattering force: describes the momentum transfer from photons to atoms, where 
          \( \hbar k \) is photon momentum, \( \Gamma \) the natural linewidth, \( I \) the laser intensity, 
          \( I_{\text{sat}} \) the saturation intensity, and \( \Delta \) the detuning.
        </div>
      </div>
    
      <div class="equation">
        
    
    \[
          F_{\text{MOT}} \approx -\kappa x
        \]
    
    
        <div class="equation-desc">
          Restoring force in a MOT: atoms experience a position-dependent force proportional to displacement \( x \), 
          with spring constant \( \kappa \) set by the magnetic field gradient and laser parameters.
        </div>
      </div>
    </section>
    
    <section>
      <h3>Why MOTs Matter</h3>
      <p>
        MOTs enable the study of atoms at ultracold temperatures, opening the door to further experiments with: quantum simulations, 
        atomic clocks, Bose-Einstein condensates, and precision tests of fundamental physics. 
        They are an essential experimental tool for trapping and cooling of neutral atoms.
      </p>

      <h2>Methods</h2>
      <p>
        When we have a certain tehory, we can set up an experiment to test its validity. Designing the experiments themselves
        are not an easy task. It requires careful consideration and precision is important if we want to later make conclusions
        based on our results.

    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Data collection</h2>
      <p>
        When the experiment is set up, we have to collect data. Already here on the image, we see exactly 
        what we would expect - a little glowing dot in the middle of our glass cell. This glowing dot are
        the trapped atoms.

      </div>
      <p class="img-caption">A glass cell containing trapped rubidium atoms.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Results</h2>
      <p>
        The result is what we actually measure, and that is very rarely the phenomena itself. We can't directly 
        "measure" the atoms, but we can't measure the light that they emit. That is an important distinction in
        many physics experiments. 
      </p>

      </div>
      <p class="img-caption">Heat map for the intensity of the trapped rubidium atoms.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Analysis</h2>
      <p>
        When we have our results, they are rarely useful directly, without being processed and the experiment repeated. 
        On the following graph, each dot represents one full experiment where we trapped a lot of atoms. Each time 
        changeing slightly over settings. Now we get a graph were we can examine the general tendencies that emerges.

      </div>
      <p class="img-caption">Data collected by repeated experiments to see tendencies.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        Based on our data analysis, we can examine wether what we observe was similar to what we predicted from our theory.
        In this case we did indeed trap atoms, and they behaved as expected when we changed different parameters, so 
        we could not disprove the theory. Many others have tried as well, and failed to disproved, so our modern understanding
        of how atoms interact with lasers, and how we can trap them - is generally cosidered to be true today.
