      <h2>What is Mechanics?</h2>
      <p>
        Mechanics is the branch of physics concerned with the motion of bodies under the influence of forces. It lays the foundation for understanding how objects move, interact, and respond to forces, from everyday phenomena to complex systems in engineering and astronomy.

      Main thing to know: <br />
      <strong>Newton's Laws of Motion</strong> describe the relationship between forces acting on a body and its motion.

      <h2>Key Equations in Mechanics</h2>

      <div class="equation">
        \[
          \mathbf{F} = m \mathbf{a}
        \]
        <div class="equation-desc">Newton’s Second Law: The force \( \mathbf{F} \) acting on a mass \( m \) produces an acceleration \( \mathbf{a} \).</div>
      </div>

      <p>
        This fundamental law explains how forces affect motion.
      </p>

      <div class="equation">
        \[
          \mathbf{p} = m \mathbf{v}
        \]
        <div class="equation-desc">Momentum: The momentum \( \mathbf{p} \) of an object is its mass times its velocity \( \mathbf{v} \).</div>
      </div>

      <p>
        Momentum is a measure of the quantity of motion.
      </p>

      <div class="equation">
        \[
          \mathbf{F} = \frac{d\mathbf{p}}{dt}
        \]
        <div class="equation-desc">Force as the time derivative of momentum.</div>
      </div>

      <p>
        This is a more general form of Newton's Second Law.
      </p>

      <div class="equation">
        \[
          W = \mathbf{F} \cdot \mathbf{d}
        \]
        <div class="equation-desc">Work: Work done by a force \( \mathbf{F} \) acting over a displacement \( \mathbf{d} \).</div>
      </div>

      <p>
        Work transfers energy to or from a system.
      </p>

      <div class="equation">
        \[
          K = \frac{1}{2} m v^2
        \]
        <div class="equation-desc">Kinetic Energy: Energy due to motion of an object.</div>
      </div>

      <p>
        Important in understanding energy conservation.
      </p>

      <div class="equation">
        \[
          U = m g h
        \]
        <div class="equation-desc">Potential Energy: Gravitational potential energy near Earth's surface.</div>
      </div>

      <h2>Further Details</h2>
      <h3>Newton's Laws</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>First Law:</strong> An object remains at rest or in uniform motion unless acted upon by a force.</li>
        <li><strong>Second Law:</strong> Force equals mass times acceleration.</li>
        <li><strong>Third Law:</strong> For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Applications</h3>
      <p>
        Mechanics is essential in engineering, biomechanics, astrophysics, and everyday problem solving involving forces and motion.
